#2 Variable number of arguments: *args (positional arugment packing)
"""Notice how the print() function does not care how many arguments we pass to it. It has no expectation that we are going to pass in one argument or even a million! So the question is, how does print() accomplish this?

Well, in Python, there is an additional operator called the unpacking operator (*). The unpacking operator allows us to give our functions a variable number of arguments by performing whatâ€™s known as positional argument packing.
